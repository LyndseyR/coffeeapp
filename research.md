## Counter Culture

### Goal of Project
Design an app that brings a story to each cup of coffee. Their site has a ton of fascinating information. Goal is to make it easy for the user(target family households) to purchase coffee and immediately know the story.

### Background of Counter Culture
They were founded in 1995. They focus on wholesale, teaching everything about coffee, and sustainability. They only sell to coffee shops/restaurants that share their same values and will pass on the message of sustainability. There is no such thing as locally grown coffee. They have visited every site they buy from to set up communication with the farmers. They believe the best coffee starts with providing the best service to the farmer. This is why they sell their single origin coffee around $3.53/lb while the market value is $1.30. They want to be able to support the farmers so they can make a livelihood from coffee.

### SWOT of Counter Culture
**Strengths** they are an amazing morally based company. Be fair to farmers/growers, help provide education to anyone interested, they're transparent. Promote employees to do environmental projects by matching up to $500 of a personal project of their choice. **Weaknesses**, being fair means you have to be more expensive. Their site has a lot of information and you'll need hours to sort through it all. **Opportunities** you can really know what you're drinking and who you're effecting. **Threats** goes back to prices being higher.
